    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ashoka the Great (r. 268-232 BCE) was the third king of the Mauryan
     Empire (322-185 BCE) best known for his renunciation of war,
      development of the concept of dhamma (pious social conduct),
       and promotion of Buddhism as well as his effective reign of 
       a nearly pan-Indian political entity.
At its height, under Ashoka, the Mauryan Empire stretched 
from modern-day Iran through almost the entirety of the Indian
 subcontinent. Ashoka was able to rule this vast empire initially
  through the precepts of the political treatise known as the 
  Arthashastra, attributed to the Prime Minister Chanakya 
  (also known as Kautilya and Vishnugupta, l. c. 350-275 BCE)
   who served under Ashoka's grandfather
Chandragupta (r. c. 321-c.297 BCE) who founded the empire.<br><br><br>
Ashoka means “without sorrow” which was most likely his given 
name. He is referred to in his edicts, carved in stone, as 
Devanampiya Piyadassi which, according to scholar John Keay
 (and agreed upon by scholarly consensus) means “Beloved of
  the Gods” and “gracious of mien” (89). He is said to have
   been particularly ruthless early in his reign until he launched
    a campaign against the Kingdom of Kalinga in c. 260 BCE which 
    resulted in such carnage, destruction, and death that Ashoka 
    renounced war and, in time, converted to Buddhism, devoting 
    himself to peace as exemplified in his concept of dhamma
    . Most of what is known of him, outside of his edicts, 
    comes from Buddhist texts which
 treat him as a model of conversion and virtuous behavior.
